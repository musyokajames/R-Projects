Nairobi county has the highest number of dewormed people, while Lamu county has the lowest number.

*It is important to note however that the population in the two counties differs greatly, with Nairobi having a very high population which translates to more people being dewormed.*

Wajir County has the highest number of Acute malnutrition while Baringo County has the lowest.

Wajir Countyâ€™s high levels of acute malnutrition may be driven by recurrent droughts leading to food and water scarcity, widespread poverty, limited access to healthcare and sanitation services, low caregiver awareness on nutrition, and ongoing insecurity that disrupts livelihoods and aid delivery.

The Boxplot is wide indicate more variation across the counties.

There are outliers, like Wajir, which have very high rates of acute malnutrition.

```{r }

       x = "Total Diarrhoea Cases",
       y = "Underweight Population")+
  theme_bw()

```
There is a positive relationship between the two. As Diarrhoea cases increased the underweight population in those counties went up. 

However, correlation is not causation.
